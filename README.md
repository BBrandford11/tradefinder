# Jobber clone

## Description

This is my a excercise to combine and practice retrieving and submitting to MongoDB. The app could be used to allow trade workers to view and bid on local construction jobs. I created the map using the Leafley api and populated the markers for each jobsite location from the database.

## Some small things I would like to work on in the future would be
- Clean up the css on map page
- able to view all trades workers and there qualifications
- integrate different filters for markers
