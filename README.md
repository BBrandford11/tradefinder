# Jobber clone

## Description

This is my a excercise to combine and practice retrieving and submitting to MongoDB and the front end coppy of Jobber. The app could be used to allow trade workers to view and bid on local construction jobs. I created the map using the Leafley api and populated the markers for each jobsite location from the database.

## Some small things I would like to work on in the future would be
- Clean up the css on map page
- able to view all trades workers and there qualifications
- integrate different filters for markers 
- allow trade workers to email bids to jobsites
